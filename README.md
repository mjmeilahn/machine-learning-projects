# Machine Learning Projects

1. Data Preprocessing - Basics of importing data, filling in empty values, split observations between test and training groups. Feature scaling applied to normalize model.

2. Simple Linear Regression - Requires at least one dependent variable (like Salary) one independent variable (like Years of Exprience) and a constant (starting point like zero). Chart is visualized as a linear graph either upwards or downwards with various points of observations. Formula is Y = MX + B. Various tools exist outside of Python to visualize like R, GRETL or a SAS product. The higher amount of observations lead to a lower P-Value to predict significance.
